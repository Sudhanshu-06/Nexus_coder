    <h1>Biography of Nikola Tesla</h1>
    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree. He then gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884, he immigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen.</p>

    <h2>Carrer</h2>
    <p>In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company.[37] Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors</p>

    <h2>Achievements</h2>
    <p>Soon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system,[56] possibly the same one he had developed at Edison.[42] In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents</p>
